What is the code agenda: 

I made this to be a supervision on servers that don't allow swearing.
"Bot" Dyno inspired me to make this because i wanted to know how the bot worked.
The main code has been written and published in python using vs code editor.
Discord has a "developer portal" where you can make your own discord bot and use discords API called "discord.py".

Features:
Ban command, bans a member of choice, from the server.
Kick command, kicks a member of choice, from the server
Warn command, warn a member of choice.
Unban command, unbans a member (already banned), from the server.

Warns members for swearing and logs it, in a discord channel, the terminal and a text file then proceeds to delete the message.

Warns a member for spamming (Too much messages in certain amount of time).
